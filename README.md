# EzRename
Do you hate color codes? Do you ever wish you could type ✱orange✱
EzRename is a spigot plugin which aims to make renaming items with color codes easier. EzRename allows you to rename using default colorcodes (i.e. &6) and also allows you to use color names with * Orange * . EzRename also adds suppourt for striked (* s * ), underlined (* u * ), and italics (* i * ) removing the need for you to remember all of minecrafts color codes.

Example usages: /ezrename * pink * God * gray * Soup and /ezrename * pink * God&7Soup

Pictures. (They look hard to understand, but when you're making the name it's easy)
