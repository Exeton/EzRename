# EzRename
EzRename is a spigot plugin which aims to make renaming items with color codes easier. EzRename allows you to rename using default colorcodes (i.e. &6) and also allows you to use color names with *Orange*. EzRename also adds suppourt for striked (*s*), underlined (*u*), and italics (*i*) removing the need for you to remember all of minecrafts color codes.

Example usages: /ezrename *pink*God*gray*Soup and /ezrename *pink*God&7Soup
